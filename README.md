# https---github.com-Esuabom-myjobmag_scrapper
This bot is built to scrape data from www.myjobmag.com.
Its strictly for educational purpose, I have no intention of using data gotten from this site for financial gain.
Challenge encountered: loop function stops working after scrapping some data, I guess the myjobmag.com server detects this and stops the action, will get more info from the developers of the site
Job left to be done: Replace print fuctions with trace logs for debbuging purpose; replace time delays with explicit wait functions; handle ads pop up; provision the bot to scrape morthan one job info from job link.
